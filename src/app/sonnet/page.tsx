Is it thy will, thy image should keep open<br/>
My heavy eyelids to the weary night?<br/>
Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken,<br/>
While shadows like to thee do mock my sight?<br/>
Is it thy spirit that thou sendâ€™st from thee<br/>
So far from home into my deeds to pry,<br/>
To find out shames and idle hours in me,<br/>
The scope and tenure of thy jealousy?<br/>
O, no! thy love, though much, is not so great:<br/>
It is my love that keeps mine eye awake:<br/>
Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat,<br/>
To play the watchman ever for thy sake:<br/>
    For thee watch I, whilst thou dost wake elsewhere,<br/>
    From me far off, with others all too near.<br/>
